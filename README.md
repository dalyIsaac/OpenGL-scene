## Building

This guide assumes that `g++` is present on the machine, and that the computer is running Linux (Ubuntu 18.04). This may or may not work for other distributions or operating systems.

### Using Visual Studio Code

The following assumes that CMake is present on the machine.

1. Install the recommended extensions
2. If CMake is not running:
   1. Select a kit (optional), by running from the command palette `CMake: Select a Kit`
   2. Select a variant (optional), by running from the command palette `CMake: Set the current build variant`
   3. Run `CMake: Configure` from the command palette.
3. Build, by running from the command palette `CMake: Build`.
4. To run the project, either run:
   - `CMake: Execute the current target without a debugger`
   - `CMake: Debug Target`
  
### Building from the terminal

From the project root, run:

``` console
user@domain:~/path/to/project/COSC363-Assignment-1$ ./build.sh
```
